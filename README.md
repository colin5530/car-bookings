Requires http-server to run.

To install http-server
`npm install http-server`

To run the application, run `http-server .` from project root

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to view the application

Notes:
It may be necessary to disable cache for the application to work correctly

In the interest of saving time, I am using innerHTML in a few places in this application, though normally this is not a good idea and should be avoided.
