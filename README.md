In the interest of saving time, I am using innerHTML in a few places in this application, though normally this is not a good idea and should be avoided.

I made the decision not to go down the traditional route of HTML + JS, choosing to go with a more JavaScript focused method. I'm not sure if the more traditional approach would be more in line with what is required, but I decided to go the Javascript route as it lines up more with how I think web development is actually done these days. If this was an incorrect assumption and you would rather see the more traditional approach I can redo it in that way.
